twitter-radio
=============

This  project for the Raspberry Pi allows the RPi to become a radio which vocalises a twitter stream.  It uses the public twitter search interface to retrieve tweets according to defined criteria.  It keeps track of the last tweet seen so that tweets are not repeated. Tweets are filtered (eg RTs are ignored) and cleaned up for better vocalisation, before sending to espeak for TTS
